At this point, the voice is subsumed by static, and nothing can be made out until GLaDOS counts down to the vault opening. The vault opens with a portal, creating a hole in space from one place to another. Looking through this portal, you can see yourself in the vault. Exit the vault and proceed to the next room. In the next room, pick up the cube and put it on the button to open the door. The door will open, and you can proceed to the chamberlock to get to the next area."}]}
